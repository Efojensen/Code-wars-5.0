Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

Examples:

* 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
* 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']

Ohhhh mannnn!
Now this one was a real problem. I'd first like to apologize for performing this mission in python when I promised that I'd do it in JavaScript.
Yeah..., I still need some time to get it down completely.
So here's how this one went. The objective as you can see above was to take a string and split it into groups of letters of 2 each.
It the length of the string was odd, then I'd just add an underscore sign and make it even and then split it.
At first glance, the problem looked easy enough to handle but when I actually got down to solving it... Well, let's just say it reared it's ugly head at me.
Thankfully, I was able to solve it after some long thinking, debugging and moping about and now the problem is now solved.
I do not think this code is well designed so those who could help in designing it should please reach out.
I used a while loop in a while loop in a conditional statement and used some brute force breaks in it so it wouldn't go beyond what I wanted.
Well, until next time, may the force be with you.
